# Mark In A Box Construction

# Features / Look and Feel

The intention of this box was to make it as unassuming and dead simple to operate.  As this was a memorial to a rather unique person, it meant to have an element of surprise and not try to give away the bit before the user would interact with it.  To that, the construction is meant to be clean in design with just a box, a button and a label.

The box design was one that happened to be handy in the studio space I was using but ended up being perfect for the application.  It is a six-sided box, almost cylindar in design.  In painting it gold, it has a bit of a "urn" look to it.  I am going to skip how to build a six sided box in this document.  You can look for multi-sided glue joints router bits.
