# mark_in_a_box

## A memorial to a friend based on an Arduino Mega board and the Adafruit Audio Shield

### Introduction

Some months back a friend of mine, Mark Hernandez passed away. Mark was a smart, funny and strange guy. He was also active with KFCF in Fresno and KPFA in Berkeley. I was disappointed that there wasn't a memorial (or one I heard about) for him. I started to work on an "art piece" that I think Mark would have liked.

Fortunately, we have a bunch of audio of Mark from KFCF's RPU program that was broadcast in the early eighties. I took a number of audio snippets from this "show" and put them on an SSD card, put that on an MP3 shield for a Mega Arduino board. Stuck the electronics in a box that I painted "urn" gold and put a lit button on it. Whenever you push the button, you get a silly audio of Mark cut played back.

This repro is going to document the project and some of the considerations in building a box that plays random audio custs with a push of a button.
